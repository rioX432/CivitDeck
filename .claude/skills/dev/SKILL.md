# /dev — E2E Development Workflow

Resolve Issue $ARGUMENTS from investigation to PR creation.

**Target:** $ARGUMENTS

## Setup: Create Task Tracker

Use `TaskCreate` to create a task for each phase. This provides progress visibility and persistence across `/compact`.

1. "Gather context from issue"
2. "Investigate codebase (/dev-investigate)"
3. "Technical design (Codex)"
4. "Resolve ambiguities (/dig)"
5. "Decompose into subtasks (/decompose)"
6. "Implement changes"
7. "Run quality gate"
8. "Review changes"
9. "Commit & create PR"

Use `TaskUpdate` to mark each task `in_progress` when starting and `completed` when done.

## Workflow

```
Phase 1: Issue Understanding
    ↓
Phase 2: Investigation (← /dev-investigate, context: fork)
    ↓
Phase 2.5: Technical Design (← Codex, optional)
    ↓
Phase 3: Ambiguity Resolution (/dig)
    ↓
Phase 4: Task Decomposition (/decompose)
    ↓
── AskUserQuestion: confirm approach + task list ──
    ↓
Phase 5: Branch & Implement
    ↓
Phase 6: Quality Gate (build + test + lint from CLAUDE.md)
    ↓
Phase 7: Review (/review)
    ↓
── AskUserQuestion: commit + PR confirmation ──
    ↓
Phase 8: Commit & PR Creation
```

---

## Phase 1: Issue Understanding

Mark task 1 `in_progress`.

Detect the issue source from "$ARGUMENTS":

**GitHub Issue** (starts with `#` or is a number):
1. `gh issue view <number> --json number,title,body,labels,assignees,comments`
2. Extract: title, description, acceptance criteria, labels

**Linear Issue** (matches `XXX-1234` pattern):
1. Use `ToolSearch` with `+linear` to load the Linear MCP
2. Call `mcp__linear__get_issue` with the issue ID

**Figma links** in the issue description (`figma.com/design/...`):
1. Use `ToolSearch` with `+figma-remote` to load Figma MCP
2. Fetch design context and screenshot

**Branch naming** (from labels or issue type):
- Bug → `fix/{issue-ref}-{kebab-case-short-desc}`
- Otherwise → `feat/{issue-ref}-{kebab-case-short-desc}`

Read `CLAUDE.md` for project architecture and conventions.

### Migration Detection

If the issue involves library/framework updates, version bumps, or API deprecations:
1. Check labels for `migration`, `upgrade`, `dependency`, or `breaking-change`
2. If Android/KMP project and `android` CLI is available: run `android docs search "{migration topic}"` to get latest official migration guidance
3. Note migration-specific risks (breaking changes, deprecated APIs) for Phase 3 (/dig)

Mark task 1 `completed`.

---

## Phase 2: Investigation (/dev-investigate)

Mark task 2 `in_progress`.

Invoke the `/dev-investigate` skill to run investigation in a forked context. This keeps large Read results isolated from this context.

```
Skill("dev-investigate", args: "{issue title}. {issue description}. Keywords: {keywords}. Affected areas: {areas from labels/description}")
```

After the skill completes, read the investigation report:

```
Read("investigation-report.md")
```

### Think Twice

After reading the report:
1. Is the investigation thorough? All affected files identified?
2. Are there other possible causes not considered?
3. Is impact analysis complete?

If anything is ambiguous, use `AskUserQuestion`. **Never assume.**

Mark task 2 `completed`.

---

## Phase 2.5: Technical Design (Codex)

Mark task 3 `in_progress`.

Use Codex to generate a technical design before diving into ambiguity resolution and decomposition.

### Load Codex

```
ToolSearch("select:mcp__codex__codex")
```

### Call Codex

If Codex is available:

```
mcp__codex__codex(
  prompt: "Given this investigation report and issue, produce a technical design:

  ## Issue
  {issue title and description}

  ## Investigation Findings
  {summary from investigation-report.md}

  ## Affected Files
  {affected files table from report}

  ## Design Request
  1. Propose the implementation approach (architecture, data flow changes)
  2. Identify interface changes and new abstractions needed
  3. List edge cases and error handling strategy
  4. Flag risks and trade-offs

  Output a concise technical design document."
)
```

Save the design output for use in Phase 3 (/dig) and Phase 4 (/decompose).

### Fallback (Codex unavailable)

If `ToolSearch` fails to find Codex or the call errors:
- Skip this phase — proceed to Phase 3 with investigation results only (traditional flow)
- Log: "Codex unavailable, skipping technical design phase"

Mark task 3 `completed`.

---

## Phase 3: Ambiguity Resolution

Mark task 4 `in_progress`.

Use the `/dig` skill with investigation results (and Codex design if available) to resolve decision points.

Mark task 4 `completed`.

---

## Phase 4: Task Decomposition

Mark task 5 `in_progress`.

Use the `/decompose` skill to break the work into ordered subtasks.

Mark task 5 `completed`.

---

## ── AskUserQuestion: Approach Confirmation ──

Present to the user:
1. **Decision Matrix** (from /dig)
2. **Task List** (from /decompose, with dependencies)
3. **Investigation summary** (key findings)

Ask the user to confirm before implementation.

---

## Phase 5: Branch & Implement

Mark task 6 `in_progress`.

### 5a. Create Branch

```bash
git checkout -b {branch-name}
```

### 5b. Implement

**TDD mode** (when issue has `tdd` label, or test changes are the primary goal):
```
LOOP for each subtask:
  1. TaskUpdate → in_progress
  2. Read target code
  3. Write/update tests FIRST (use test-writer agent if needed)
  4. Run tests — confirm they FAIL (red)
  5. Implement the minimal code to pass
  6. Run tests — confirm they PASS (green)
  7. Refactor if needed (keep tests passing)
  8. TaskUpdate → completed
```

**Standard mode** (default):
```
LOOP for each subtask (in dependency order):
  1. TaskUpdate → in_progress
  2. Read target code (MUST read before editing)
  3. Implement changes (Edit/Write)
  4. Self-verify (run Verify step from task description)
  5. TaskUpdate → completed

INTERRUPT conditions:
  - Unexpected problem → AskUserQuestion
  - 3 consecutive failures → STOP and report
```

Guidelines:
- Follow existing code patterns (read surrounding code first)
- Follow CLAUDE.md conventions
- Keep changes minimal and focused

Mark task 6 `completed`.

---

## Phase 6: Quality Gate

Mark task 7 `in_progress`.

Run the project's build, test, and lint commands as defined in CLAUDE.md's Commands section.

If CLAUDE.md doesn't specify commands, detect from project files:
- `build.gradle.kts` / `gradlew` → `./gradlew build`, `./gradlew test`, `./gradlew detekt`
- `package.json` → `npm test`, `npm run lint`
- `Cargo.toml` → `cargo build`, `cargo test`, `cargo clippy`
- `pyproject.toml` / `setup.py` → `pytest`, `ruff check`

### Failure Handling
1. Analyze the failure
2. Fix the issue
3. Re-run the failing check
4. **Maximum 3 fix attempts** — if still failing, report to user and stop

Mark task 7 `completed`.

---

## Phase 7: Review

Mark task 8 `in_progress`.

Use the `/review` skill to run multi-agent parallel review.

### Structured Review Output

After the review completes, write `workspace/{issue}/review.json`:

```json
{
  "issue": "{issue reference}",
  "branch": "{branch name}",
  "timestamp": "{ISO 8601}",
  "status": "clean | warnings | critical",
  "counts": {
    "critical": 0,
    "warning": 0,
    "suggestion": 0,
    "nit": 0
  },
  "findings": [
    {
      "severity": "critical | warning | suggestion | nit",
      "file": "path/to/file",
      "line": 42,
      "description": "description of finding",
      "resolved": false
    }
  ]
}
```

### Review Result Handling
- **Critical**: STOP. Report to user. Do NOT proceed.
- **Warning**: Fix, re-run Quality Gate (Phase 6). Update `review.json` findings as `"resolved": true`.
- **Suggestion**: Note but don't block

Mark task 8 `completed`.

---

## ── AskUserQuestion: Commit + PR Confirmation ──

Show the user:
1. Summary of all changes
2. Quality gate results
3. Review findings and resolutions
4. Proposed commit message (single line, no AI stamps)

---

## Phase 8: Commit & PR Creation

Mark task 9 `in_progress`.

### 8a. Commit
```bash
git add {specific files}
git commit -m "{concise message}"
```
- Explicit file staging (no `git add .`)
- No Co-Authored-By, no AI stamps

### 8b. Push & PR
```bash
git push -u origin {branch-name}
```

Use the project's `pull_request_template.md` if available. Only fill in Description and Related Issues.

```bash
gh pr create --title "#{issue} {description}" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Description
- {bullet point summary}

## Related Issues
Closes #{issue}
EOF
)"
```

Report PR URL to the user.

Mark task 9 `completed`.

---

## Autonomous Mode (/goal)

When the user invokes `/dev` with `/goal`, the workflow runs autonomously:

```
/goal "Issue $ARGUMENTS is resolved: tests pass, review has no Critical findings, and PR is created"
```

In autonomous mode:
- Skip `AskUserQuestion` confirmations — proceed with best judgment
- Stop on Critical review findings or 3 consecutive failures (these still require human input)
- The `/goal` evaluator checks the completion condition after each phase

### Structured Return Value

On completion, output a structured result for callers (e.g., `/dev-all`):

```json
{
  "issue": "{issue reference}",
  "status": "success | failed | blocked",
  "pr_url": "https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/N",
  "review": {
    "status": "clean | warnings | critical",
    "critical_count": 0,
    "warning_count": 0
  },
  "failure_reason": null
}
```

### AskUserQuestion Skip Rules

In autonomous mode, `AskUserQuestion` is skipped when:
1. **Approach confirmation** (Phase 4): Proceed with the decomposed task list
2. **Commit + PR confirmation** (Phase 8): Proceed if review status is `clean` or `warnings` (no unresolved criticals)

`AskUserQuestion` is NOT skipped when:
1. **Critical review findings**: Always stop and report
2. **3 consecutive failures**: Always stop and report
3. **Unexpected errors**: Always stop and report

## Error Handling

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Issue not found | Report error, stop |
| Figma fetch fails | Warn, continue without design |
| Investigation unclear | AskUserQuestion before proceeding |
| Tests fail (≤3 attempts) | Fix and retry |
| Tests fail (>3 attempts) | Report to user, stop |
| Critical review finding | Report to user, stop |
| Warning review finding | Fix, re-run quality gate |
| Git/PR creation fails | Report error, stop |
